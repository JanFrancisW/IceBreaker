# IceBreaker
Created my own Ice Breakers game. Try to trap the other player!

You can move your player to any adjacent square bby clicking in it. Then you can 'break the ice' by clicking any square to change the colour to blue, which will make that square off limits when moving. Then it is Player 2's turn to do the same.

You win by trapping the other player in blue quares. It is a bit glitchy, but let's be real, no one will probably play this.
