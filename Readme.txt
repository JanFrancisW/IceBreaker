This project folder contains the main Ice Breaker game-Cmpt103F20_X02L_MS3_JW.py.  The directory also contains the image objects for the players, and the graphics python script needed to run the program. 

I built this program without global variables. IÕd use them another time around. But to avoid them seemed like the simpler option at outset of the project. 

I tried to build the program using small functions and create variables that could be used in various functions; these are the variables that I would make global next time.

As IÕve never built a program over a longer period of time, how to continually stay organized was a challenge. The importance of planning and documentation stands out. 

The two functions I struggled with the most were turn_play and is_trapped. Turn_play was the most complex function in the program, and knowing exactly what line of code was being executed took a bit of time to grasp. Is_trapped I could never fully implement, iterating through the newer to me data structures like a LoL and dealing with the exceptions was a challenge.

Building out a GUI from scratch taught me how complex they are and how many variable situations there are to account for.
